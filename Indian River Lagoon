We've been working on projects to remediate and restore the Indian River Lagoon on Florida's East Coast, in the 'Space Coast' and 'Treasure 
Coast' areas.  We work with as many of the stakeholders as want to work on this.  We have had major algae blooms, fish kills, and sea-grass 
losses since Tropical Storm Fay in 2005 dropped 25" of rain on us in ten days and washed huge amounts of fertilizer and organic matter off 
the land and into the lagoon.  Storm water, point sources like the 1.33M gallons of raw sewage that came from a broken pipe in Indian 
Harbor Beach this week, and seepage from individual homes' septic systems, put hundreds of tons of Nitrogen and tens of tons of phosphates
in to lagoon each year.  Major discharges of Lake Okeechobee water via the St. Lucie River this year Helped make this a banner year for 
blue-green algae (Cyanobacteria).  Prevention has to be a major focus, but remediation and restortation have to be planned and carried out 
alongside prevention.  Take a look at the websites for the Indian River Lagoon Council and for Brevard County Natural Resources 
Management.  There are good summaries of the issues, images, and supporting materials on them.
For our part, we are doing some hardware and software development for sensing conditions in the lagoon.  Working with Cura Oceanus, a local 
non-profit, reaching out to the middle- and high-school students who are interested in STEM subjects appears to have two good outcomes:
STEM education with hands-on sensing, data collection, and data interpreting projects; and commitment by our youngsters to preserving this 
unique and valuable environment.
Tools include Raspberry Pi platforms with Raspian and Python software.  I build hardware prototypes.
